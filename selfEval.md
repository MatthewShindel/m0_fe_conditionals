# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel confident in my understanding of comparison operators. I can read each on off of a webpage and understand what each operators does with the values it is given. I still need some practice with remembering all of the operators when I'm working by myself, as sometimes I'll forget which operator to use in a certain situation. 


2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I think that I'm more confident in my understanding and fluency with logical operators than I am with comparison operators, since there are only 2 logical operators to rememeber right now. Right now, it's easy to see and understand how to use the logical operators in a problem.

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I think my level of understanding and fluence with if statements is pretty good. The main thought that I'm having right now isn't that the problems are too difficult, but that I feel like there are simpler solutions to the problems that I can use rather than what I'm doing now.

4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I spent about about 1 hour working on this lesson. Most of the tasks were straight forward, though I did spend a good amount of time solving the spicyChallenge in the codeChallenges directory. This is roughly the amount it time I expected the spend on this lesson.

5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to practice using Git commands in terminal. I keep finding myself going back to my notes to remember how to pull from my repository, as well as removing and adding my remote connection to my Github. Additionally, I think i need to improve on my syntax for my assignments. I've caught myself forgetting to put semicolons at the end of line in a js file. I think to fix this challenge, I'll keep practicing on my free time to remember the important commands, mainly through using flashcards, as well as using some online note taking app to keep track of the important information I eed for class. 

As for my calendar usage, I think I'm on track with the amount of time I've given myself. I think I'll need to make more time for myself in the morning once we're in module 1, since I'll need the rest of the day for classes.

5. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't have any pressing questions right now. The only questions I have is moreso a questions of simplifing my "if" statements so that there more elegant.
